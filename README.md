# 📝 Today I Learned (TIL)

> A personal knowledge base documenting my daily technical discoveries and engineering challenges.

I created this repository to consolidate the technical concepts, code snippets, and solutions I encounter while working on my academic and personal projects.

## 📂 Topics & Categories

My learnings are categorized based on the technologies I use in my active projects:

### 📱 Mobile Development
* **[React Native](./React-Native)**: Insights from building cross-platform apps using Expo, React Navigation, and Axios (e.g., *Profiles Directory App*).

### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
* **[AI Agents](./AI-ML)**: Notes on Multi-Agent Systems and Google ADK (e.g., *MedCase AI*).
* **[Deep Learning](./AI-ML)**: Research on LSTM, Transformers, and MediaPipe for Sign Language Recognition (e.g., *TIDFlow*).
* **[ML Algorithms](./AI-ML)**: Usage of XGBoost/LightGBM for anomaly detection.

### 🔐 Cybersecurity
* **[Network Security](./Cybersecurity)**: Real-time threat detection, IDS, and traffic analysis (e.g., *Graduation Project*).

### ⚙️ Backend & APIs
* **[FastAPI & Python](./Backend-API)**: Building scalable REST APIs and handling asynchronous operations.
